In this chapter, we will create a single-page app in React that retrieves data from an API and
runs in the browser with Webpack and Babel. Styling will be done using Bootstrap.
The app will show information about the popular TV show Rick and Morty along with images.


Requirements and steps:

It requires the React Dev Tool plugin for Chrome. 
You can install it from the Chrome Web Store, and npm v6.14.3 or later and node v14.17.0 or later.

Commands:

The command "npm init -y" will create a fresh package.json file with the bare minimum of information needed to 
run a JavaScript/React project. By adding the -y flag to the command, we can automatically skip 
the steps where we set information such as the name, version, and description.
After running this command, package.json file will be created.


Webpack:
To run React, we need to install Webpack and Webpack CLI as devDependencies.

Webpack is a library that let us create a bundle out of JS/React code that can be used in a browser:

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli


After installation, these packages are included inside the package.json file where 
we can have them run in our start and build scripts. But first, we need to add
a src folder with index.js in it (index.js will be the starting point of the app).

In package.json modify scripts to:

  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  },

  the npm start will run Webpack in dev mode 
  the npm run build will create a production bundle using Webpack (minimizes code and decreases the size of the project bundle)
