In this chapter, we will create a single-page app in React that retrieves data from an API and
runs in the browser with Webpack and Babel. Styling will be done using Bootstrap.
The app will show information about the popular TV show Rick and Morty along with images.

It reuires the React Dev Tool plugin for Chrome. You can install it from the Chrome Web Store, and npm v6.14.3 or later and node v14.17.0 or later.
