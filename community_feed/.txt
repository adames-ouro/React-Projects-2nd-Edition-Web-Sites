To Support Server Side Rendering (SSR), we can use Next.js

With SSR, Seaarch Engine Optimization (SEO), SSR comes with the advantage that we can add
metadata to the app so it can be indexed by search engines.

In this project, we will create a community feed application using Next.js that supports 
SSR and therefore is loaded from the server rather than the browser. This app will be 
optimized for search engines.

Since we have SSR, this app can be deployed to Vercel.
